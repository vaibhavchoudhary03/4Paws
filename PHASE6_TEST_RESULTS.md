# Phase 6 Testing Results - People Management & Intake Workflow

## 🎯 **Issue Resolution Summary**

### **✅ Problem Identified and Fixed:**
The localhost:3000 crashes were caused by **TypeScript compilation errors** that prevented the React app from building properly. The main issues were:

1. **Broken Intake Wizard Code** - Missing formData variables and functions
2. **Type Mismatches** - Incorrect property names and type assignments
3. **Missing Imports** - PhotoUpload component import issue
4. **Form Schema Issues** - Mismatched field names between forms and schemas

### **🔧 Fixes Applied:**

1. **Fixed Intake Wizard** (`apps/4paws-web/src/pages/intake/wizard.tsx`):
   - ✅ Converted to proper React Hook Form with FormField components
   - ✅ Fixed PhotoUpload import (default import instead of named import)
   - ✅ Replaced broken formData references with form.getValues()
   - ✅ Updated all form steps to use proper form validation

2. **Fixed People Management** (`apps/4paws-web/src/pages/people/index.tsx`):
   - ✅ Updated form field names to match schema (first_name, last_name, role)
   - ✅ Fixed form validation and submission logic

3. **Server Stability**:
   - ✅ Killed all conflicting processes
   - ✅ Started clean development server on port 3000
   - ✅ Verified server is running stably
